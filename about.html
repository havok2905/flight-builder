    <h3>Why did I make this?</h3>
    <p>
      I made this app to explore a few various things I've been
      studying in my free time.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>React</li>
      <li>Algorithms</li>
      <li>Data Structures</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      I wanted to see how I can bridge these three topics
      in a way that was interesting and fun to work on.
      I'm a huge craft beer nut, so this was a natural fit!

    <h3>Goals</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Write all application code in ES6+</li>
      <li>Approach the app from a service oriented perspective</li>
      <li>Keep view logic thin and concerned only with maintaining component state</li>
      <li>Make use of one traditional data structure</li>
      <li>Make use of one comparison algorithm in the form of a custom NPM module</li>
      <li>Encapsulate one graph type in a React component</li>
    </ul>
